#  Some users do not have access to the production Delius application but do have access to the production data
#  through other production-like environments.   In order to support auditing of the activities of these users
#  they must be added as "stub" records into the production database to which audited interaction records may
#  be linked.   As they do not have a corresponding LDAP entry this does not provide login permissions for the
#  production application.
#
#  The variable containing Audit Stub Users CANNOT be kept in an inventory file (which would be the usual case
#  for data) because it contains information which cannot be made publically available.   Therefore this data
#  is kept in a separate role within its own repository which may be included here.    
#
#  The repository is called hmpps-delius-audit-stub-accounts
#
#  If running from an AWS Codebuild job then this repository will have been downloaded as a Secondary Source
#  (This supplies the necessary GitHub security token to fetch the private repository).
#
#  Otherwise, if run outside of AWS, then the repository must be placed on the Ansible Roles path.
#
