# When Materialized Views are refreshed this creates child SQL cursors which are not reusable
# since they use Flashback Query.  Since the refreshes happen frequently, the shared pool can
# begin to fill up with hundreds of versions of the same refresh queries, which can occupy
# considerable amounts of memory and deprive it from other components of the database.
#
# For details see: Using the Flashback Query Feature Results in a High Number of Child Cursors (Doc ID 2192862.1)
#
# An SR 3-35666063241 was raised with Oracle for this behaviour but has been closed on the
# basis that it is expected for Materialized View refreshes.
#
# As a workaround we install a scheduler job to clean up the child cursors.
# This job detects non-reusable materialized view refresh cursors and force purges them
# from the shared pool to allow this memory to be reused.
