# This playbook used to manage OEM blackouts originally had the tasks defined within it. The tasks have now been moved
# to the role oracle-oem-blackout in the modernisation-platform-configuration-management repository.
# Instead of calling this playbook directly, it is recommended to call the role directly in your playbooks or workflows.
#
# Example inclusion of the role in a workflow:
#      - name: Checkout Ansible Required Roles From modernisation-platform-configuration-management
#        uses: actions/checkout@v4
#        with:
#          repository: ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-configuration-management
#          sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false
#          sparse-checkout: |
#            ansible/roles/oracle-oem-blackout
#
# Example usage in a playbook:
#    - name: Start OEM Blackout
#      import_role:
#        name: oracle-oem-blackout
#      vars:
#        blackout: "oms_ru_patching"
#        object_type: all
#        action: start
#      tags: blackout
