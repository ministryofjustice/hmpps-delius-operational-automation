# When new tables do not have optimizer statistics gathered, any SQL against these tables will be
# optimized using dynamic sampling.   Since these are new tables, the data shape will be volatile.
# Therefore we do not wish to use cached SQL plans based on dynamically sampled values for a long period of
# time before re-sampling.   Therefore we periodically detect and purge these SQLs.   This
# playbook installs a DBMS_SCHEDULER job to run this purge.

# Note that lower environments are unlikely to find any plans to purge as they are restarted on
# a daily basis.
