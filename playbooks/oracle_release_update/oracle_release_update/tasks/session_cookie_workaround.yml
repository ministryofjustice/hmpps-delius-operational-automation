#  For reasons, still undiagnosed, when the prepare-clone session finished, in some cases it does not set the session cookie
#  file to COMPLETED.   Since it is still ACTIVE, the subsequent switch-clone session will report an error and not run.
#
#  As a workaround we hack this file to read COMPLETED if the prepare-clone step has completed without errors.
#  (Note that this is a binary file and we should not perform a direct string replacement on it).
