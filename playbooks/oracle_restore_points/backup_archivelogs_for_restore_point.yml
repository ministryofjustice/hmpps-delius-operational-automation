# Even with Guaranteed Restore Points Oracle will not necessarily preserve the archive logs required to flashback.
# These may have been written to a backup which has since expired making the guaranteed restore point unusable.
#
# To avoid this potential problem we create special KEEP backups of any archivelogs required for guaranteed
# restore points, to ensure that they are always usuable regardless of the backup retention configuration.
